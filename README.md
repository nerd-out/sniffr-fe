### General guidelines:

- If you've been waiting for a review for more than one day, feel free to merge it! That's why we all have admin privileges; we don't want you to be stuck for too long. If you break something, we can always fix it later -- no worries.
- If you remember, delete your package.lock, delete your node modules, and reinstall every time you make a new feature. We are keeping everything super up-to-date.
- Assign yourself any issues you want to do. Please respect other people's issues -- do not work on them, change them, or complete them without asking the other person if you can participate first.
- Feel free to do as many unassigned issues as you want! There's no upper limit to how much everyone can participate.
- If you assigned yourself an issue that you no longer want to do, just unassign the issue. No big deal!
- If you see something that needs to be done, create an issue so someone can do it. You don't have to assign yourself to issues that you create.

### sniffr's official nitpick policy:

- Suggestions that are made to someone's code that are not related to the code's basic functionality are defined as nitpicks (for instance: style, design, and optimization).
- Any nitpicks left on a PR by a reviewer should be labeled `Nit:` and then the suggestion should be made.
- All nitpicks must have the reason WHY you think it's valuable clearly written in the suggestion.
- The person who recieves the nitpick can choose whether or not to apply the nitpick to their code. They do not have to discuss the nitpick or justify their decision to the reviewer who suggested the nitpick.
